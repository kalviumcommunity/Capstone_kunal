## 🚨 Problem Statement

People often own valuable items they rarely use, while others need short-term access to those same items. However, there's a lack of trustworthy platforms that:
- Allow easy, safe item lending
- Handle transactions and disputes efficiently
- Offer a smooth user experience for both renters and lenders

**RentOpia** bridges this gap by offering a seamless rental platform with listings, bookings, payments, messaging, and admin oversight.
