RentOpia
Project Title: RentOpia - Peer-to-Peer Rental Marketplace Platform
Problem Statement
People often have items they rarely use and others who need those items temporarily. However, there is a lack of accessible platforms that connect owners and renters securely and efficiently. This gap leads to unused resources and unnecessary purchases.

RentOpia aims to bridge this gap by offering a web-based platform where users can list, rent, and manage items and services. It empowers users to generate income from idle possessions while helping others avoid the cost of purchasing new items—making rentals easy, accessible, and community-driven.

How It Works
User Authentication: Users sign up via email or Google OAuth to access the platform.

Create & Browse Listings: Users can list items with images and descriptions or search listings by category and location.

Rental & Booking: Renters select items, choose rental periods, and book directly through the platform.

Payment & Messaging: Secure payment options and real-time chat enable smooth transactions and communication.

Core Features
User Authentication: Secure login via Email and Google OAuth.

Item & Service Listings: Users can upload items with images, descriptions, pricing, and availability.

Search & Filter Functionality: Filter items by location, category, and rental price.

User Ratings & Reviews: Ratings system to maintain trust and credibility between renters and lenders.

Admin Dashboard: Admin control panel to manage users, listings, and reported content.

Booking System: Users can select rental durations and complete bookings.

Real-Time Messaging: Enables users to chat about item availability and details before renting.

Secure Payments: Integrated payment gateway for booking and payouts (future integration).
